        <strong>This is bolded text.</strong>
        <i>This is italicized text.</i>
        <u>This is underlined text.</u>
        <p>This is some text inside of a paragraph tag. However, <strong>This is bolded text.</strong></p>
        <h2>This is some h2 text, but <i>This is italicized text, and</i> This is normal text again.</h2>
        <i><h3>Text stylling should ALWAYS be inside of another tag, and not on its own, like this.</h3></i>
        <h3><i>This would be the correct way to style a whole h3 in italics.</i></h3>
